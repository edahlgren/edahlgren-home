Erin is an Irish-American software engineer and non-profit founder based in San Jose, California. Erin is proud to be from a hard-working Chicago-based family.

Erin works on turning academic research software into thriving public projects so that publicly funded science benefits many more people. She's extremely interested in how talented people can have more impact and how research and development intersect.

Erin did academic research in linguistics and computer science at a research university before leaving Chicago to go to Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, she developed low-level software systems, first for a startup, serving oncall for over 100 million users around the globe, and then for a big technology company, launching a project that saved the company millions of dollars in wasted resources.

Now she's working with small teams of collaborators and volunteers to build her non-profit into a sustainable business.
